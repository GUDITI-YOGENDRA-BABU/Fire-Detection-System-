# Fire-Detection-System-
Fire incidents can lead to severe property damage, injuries, and loss of life if not detected promptly. There is a need for an intelligent fire detection system that ensures rapid detection of flames, GAS sensors or excessive heat, improving response times and enhancing safety. 

This project is a fire detection system using an ARDIUNO UNO R23, temperature sensor (TMP36), and gas sensor. It ensures rapid response and enhanced safety by detecting flames or smoke promptly.

## Features
- Monitors temperature and smoke levels.
- Alerts via LED and buzzer when thresholds are exceeded.
- Simple and scalable design.

## Components
- Arduino Uno R3
- TMP36 temperature sensor
- MQ gas sensor
- Piezo buzzer
- LED
- Resistors and connecting wires
- Breadboard



## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:https://github.com/GUDITI-YOGENDRA-BABU/Fire-Detection-System-.git
2. Open the Arduino code in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
4. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
5. Test the system using heat or smoke.
